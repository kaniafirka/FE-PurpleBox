# FE-PurpleBox

This repository contains solutions for various frontend development challenges, focusing on algorithmic problems, building a responsive user interface, and handling form data with validation.

## Features

- **Anagram Detector**: A solution that checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other.

- **Form Website**: A responsive form layout that adapts to multiple devices (Web, Tablet, and Mobile), with built-in validation for user input.

- **Pair Sum Challenge**: An algorithm that finds all pairs of numbers in an array that sum up to a given target.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** JavaScript (for the algorithm challenges), React (for reusable components in the form)
- **CSS:** Flexbox/Grid for layout, CSS animations for UI interactions
- **State Management (Optional):** Redux for persistent form data storage

## Setup

To run each project individually, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaniafirka/FE-PurpleBox.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the specific project folder**:
   
    **Anagram Detector:**:
     ```bash
     cd anagram-detector
     ```
    **Form Website**:
     ```bash
     cd form-website
     ```
    **Pair Sum Challenge:**:
     ```bash
     cd pair-sum-challenge
     ```

3. **Install dependencies (for each project):**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server (for each project):**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Objective

This project is designed to demonstrate key skills in frontend development, such as handling form inputs, validating user data, and creating responsive layouts that work across all devices. Additionally, a focus on modular code (reusable components) and best practices in UI/UX is emphasized.

## Happy coding! ðŸš€
